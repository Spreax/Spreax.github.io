    <h1>Whats Inside A Computer?</h1>
        <h2>GPU</h2>
        <h3>The GPU also known as the graphics card stands for Graphics processing unit.
            This part of the computer gives you video on your monitor. Some computers don't have a graphics card and use integrated graphics. Just like CPU’s, GPU’s come in all different speeds and have different features that other graphics cards don't have. An example would be in a GPU for gaming, Brand new GPU’s use a new feature called ray tracing that enhances shadows and textures of objects in games.
            The most well known company that makes GPUs is Nvidia. </h3>
        <h4>How to install:</h4>
        <h5>To install the GPU, Locate the slot for the GPU which is normally located at the bottom of the motherboard. Once located, line the GPU up with the slot in the motherboard and click it into place. *Some GPUs need a power supply connection because they need a lot more power than just from the motherboard itself*.</h5>

            <h2>CPU</h2>
            <h3>also known as a processor stands for central processing unit. This piece is basically the brain of the computer. This piece is known to be the one of the most expensive part of the whole pc. It is also the most fragile part of the computer because even the smallest drop can bend the pins and damage it. Just like the GPU, the CPU can do something called overclocking. Overclocking increases the speeds of your CPU to make the part run faster and smoother. This does reduce the life expectancy of your hardware and is not recommended. The most well known companies that make CPUs are AMD and Intel.</h3>
            <h4>How to install:</h4>
            <h5>locate the CPU slot by looking at the middle of the motherboard. Push the lever down and pull it away from the CPU slot. line up the gold triangle on the CPU with the triangle on the motherboard. Slowly let go of the CPU into the slot and push the lever down and push towards the CPU slot.</h5>

                <h2>RAM</h2>
                <h3>stands for Random access memory. This is very similar to the hard drive. The ram holds tasks that are currently happening like steam, discord, your web browser, antivirus and other background processes. Just like the hard drive, you can get different sizes of ram sticks. The average amount of ram in a home computer is around 4 - 8GB. In a high end gaming computer, They will usually have 16 or 32GB of ram. There are also different types of ram. High end Gaming pc’s will normally have DDR4 ram on older computers while older computers will use ddr2 or under. The oldest kind of ram is SDRam. The most well known company that makes ram is Corsair.</h3>
                <h4>How to install:</h4>
                <h5>First, locate the ram slots. They are normally located beside the CPU slot. Once located, Open the Tabs located on both sides of the slots. Line the ram up with the slot and the gap in the slot and the ram stick. Push the ram into place (this does requires a bit of force</h5>

                    <h2>Powersupply</h2>
                    <h3>This is what supplies power to your whole computer so it can actually function. This piece connects to your motherboard, harddrives, and in some cases, it will connect to your GPU if it requires more power. Power supplies come in all kinds of voltage. Gaming computers will have a voltage level higher than normal work computers because the parts inside require a lot more power than a normal work computer. The power supply is normally the first piece you put in if you are building a computer. The most well known power supply company is Cooler master.</h3>
                    <h4>How to install:</h4>
                    <h5>How to install: Locate the big square at the back of the computer (top or bottom). Aline the power supply screw holes with the case then screw the power supply in. Once you have put all of your other parts in, connect the power supply to the following: Motherboard (multiple connections on motherboard), hard drive, CPU, GPU (Not always required), </h5>

                        <h2>Motherboard</h2>
                        <h3>The motherboard is the main piece of the computer. This piece connects most of the parts together so they can communicate with each other and transport power to each piece in order for them to function. An example of parts communicating with each other is the Fan and the CPU. (controls speed of fan)
                            The most well known company that makes Motherboards is Asus.</h3>
                        <h4>How to install:</h4>
                        <h5>To install the motherboard, make sure that the backplate is lined up with the screw holes on the motherboard then line the screw holes up on the motherboard with the case. Screw the motherboard into place.</h5>

                            <h2>Heatsink</h2>
                            <h3>The heatsink is very important to your CPU because your CPU gets extremely hot and needs something to cool it down. The heatsink takes heat away from the CPU and the fan on top of the heatsink blows the heat away from the heatsink. There are different types of cooling on heatsinks. Some use air cooling with fans and some other heatsinks use liquid cooling to take the heat away from the heatsink. The most well known company that makes heatsinks is Cooler master.</h3>
                            <h4>How to install:</h4>
                            <h5>How to install: First, apply thermal paste to the middle of the CPU about the size of a small pea. Put the heatsink on top of the CPU and screw it into place.</h5>

                                <h2>Harddrive</h2>
                                <h3>The Hard Drive is what you store your files in like things you download with be stored onto the hard drive like your games, videos, pictures or even programs like steam or discord. You can get different sizes of hard drives from 8GB all the way up 2TB if you want. The bigger the cappasity, the more expensive the hard drive will be. Another way for a hard drive to be more expensive is what kind of hard drive you want. One of the fastest hard drives right now is the SSD and that stands for Solid State Drive. A popular hard drive company right now is samsung.</h3>
                                <h4>How to install:</h4>
                                <h5>How to install: There are multiple ways to install the hard drive. Some screw into place, some slide into place and some snap into place. Look up the case model and figure out where the hard drive goes. After that, install the sata cable into the hard drive</h5>
